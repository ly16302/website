Our ocean systems test laboratory is specifically designed for model testing at the early stage of marine renewable projects. 

The combination of wave and towing capabilities in addition to a team with expertise in hydrodynamics and turbomachinery enable us to cater for the particular needs of the marine renewable energy industry (wave, tidal and offshore wind). In particular we can offer: 

* Dynamic response of support structures in wind-wave-current;
* Turbine design and turbine performance assessment;
* A bespoke design towing post capable of conducting resistance and stability tests in calm waters and waves;
* Dynamic response tests of a ship/yacht in a seaway.
* Our fully-instrumented horizontal and vertical axis tidal turbine test rigs can be deployed at very short notice on request.

The laboratory has undertaken consultancy with a wide range of clients from small companies to large corporations in experimental marine hydrodynamics.
