I am the Lecturer in Marine Renewable Energy Systems at [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk) and lead the marine renewable energy research group. I am interested in numerical methods for solving multiphysics, multiscale problems, with the application to Marine Renewables. Research ares includes:

 1. Aerodynamics and hydrodynamics
 2. Numerical methods for flow type problem, e.g. finite elements, finite volume, reduced order methods and machine learning
 3. Multiphysics coupling problem, e.g. fluid-structure interaction, fluid-radiation coupling
 4. Wave tank testing

Previously, I have worked at the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk).
