I am the Lecturer in Marine Renewable Energy Systems at [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk). I am interested in numerical methods for solving multiphysics, multiscale problems, with the application to Marine Renewables. Research ares includes:

 1. Multiphase fluid-structure interaction
 2. Experimental Wave Tank Test
 3. Fluid-radiation coupling problem
 4. Finite element analysis and mesh generation

Previously, I have worked at the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk).
