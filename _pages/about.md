I am the Lecturer in Marine Renewable Energy Systems at [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk). I am interested in numerical methods for solving multiphysics, multiscale problems, with the application to Marine Renewables. Previously, I have worked at the Department of Earth Science and Engineering  at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk).
