I am the Lecturer in Marine Renewable Energy Systems at [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk) and lead the marine energy research group. I am interested in numerical methods for solving multiphysics, multiscale problems, with the application to Marine Renewables. Research ares includes:

 1. Sustainable Ocean: hydrodynamic analysis, numerical wave tank and physical wave tank testing supported by British Council, Supergen ORE, Innovate UK, Department for Transport (DfT).
 2. Digital twin techniques: meshing techniuqes, physics and data-driven approaches for mutlphysics, multiscale modelling, multicore computing. 

Previously, I have worked at the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk).
