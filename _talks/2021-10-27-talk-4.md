The numerical solution of incompressible large flexible/rigid/multibody/multiphase flow with free surface interaction problems is extremely important and commonplace in many engineering applications: from coastal engineering, civil engineering, marine renewables to biomechanics.  Traditionally, each coupled system is modelled separately with additional jump conditions, which needs to be considered on the interfaces. In this talk, a novel general framework for the simulation of fluid-structure interaction problems involving rigid bodies, flexible solids articulated multibody and multiphase flows will be presented. All the continuum (solids, fluids, multibody) is modelled in Eulerian framework with velocity and stress as the primary variables, similar to Navier-Stokes Equations. With additional indicator function, the coupling system is discretised based on standard Marker-and-Cell method in conjunction with a fractional step approach for the pressure/velocity decoupling, similar to multiphase flow problems. Many numerical examples will be presented in order to demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the new methodology.
